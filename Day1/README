# Notes

## Functions

* Params with same type `(int x, int y)` can be simplified like this `(x, y int)`
* `$ godoc -http=:6060` will open documentation of all installed modules. Custom examples will be listed here

## Loops

* There is only `for`
* You don't need parenthesis in `for` and brackets are always required
