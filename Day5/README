# Notes

* Names for private function/properties start with lower case
* Structs are passed by copy. To pass them by value, use pointers. When declaring a pointer to a type, put a '*' before the type
* You can create type aliases. `type MyAlias originalType`
* In Go, it's `String` instead of `ToString`
* Global vars per package are define with `var`
